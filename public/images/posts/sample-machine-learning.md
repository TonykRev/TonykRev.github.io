## Getting Started with Deep Learning

Deep learning has revolutionized how we approach computer vision problems. In this tutorial, we'll build an image classifier from scratch.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0
- NumPy and Pandas

### Building the Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

Let's dive into the implementation details...
